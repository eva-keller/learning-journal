I am spending this week on the first course in the OSSU curriculum, Harvard's CS50 Introduction to programming with Python. 
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/

As I had some exposure to Python before, the first week was relatively easy. These problems were covered: 
Functions. Arguments. Side Effects. Bugs. Return Values. Variables. Comments. Pseudocode. str. Parameters. int. Operators. Interactive Mode. float. def. Scope. return.

At the end of the lecture, you can find a problem set, which is 5 different coding problems to solve to consolidate your knowledge. 
I do consult to documentation frequently. I am most of the time on the right track, using the suitable function, but I can get lost in the syntax and the logic,
how to structure that code so it executes as I want it. 

Luckily, there are hints, you can click on, and tests you can use to check if your code works as  required. 

After I submitted the problems, the solutions, I started the next week's lecture about conditionals - if. elif. else. or. and. bool. match.
This is more "exciting" as you can express more then with 'mere' functions only.

Things I need to focus on:
I need to start speaking using technical terms. 
I need to comment my code, to explain wat I did. This is just for myself during my studies.
