I am spending this week on the first course in the OSSU curriculum, Harvard's CS50 Introduction to programming with Python. 
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/

As I had some exposure to Python before, the first week was relatively easy. These problems were covered: 
Functions. Arguments. Side Effects. Bugs. Return Values. Variables. Comments. Pseudocode. str. Parameters. int. Operators. Interactive Mode. float. def. Scope. return.

At the end of the lecture, you can find a problem set, which is 5 different coding problems to solve to consolidate your knowledge. 
I do consult to documentation frequently. I am most of the time on the right track, using the suitable function, but I can get lost in the syntax and the logic,
how to structure that code so it executes as I want it. 

Luckily, there are hints, you can click on, and tests you can use to check if your code works as  required. 

After I submitted the problems, the solutions, I started the next week's lecture about conditionals - if. elif. else. or. and. bool. match.
This is more "exciting" as you can express more then with 'mere' functions only.

Things I need to focus on:
I need to start speaking using technical terms. 
I need to comment my code, to explain wat I did. This is just for myself during my studies. 

I created  a blueprint for solving the problem sets at the end of the week as I think it might help me to focus and
to get into good habits. Also, from now on, when I am working on a problem, I will be typing out my thought process, 
using the blueprint. It should get me into the habit to articulate my thoughts better and to be able to explain what and why I am doing
