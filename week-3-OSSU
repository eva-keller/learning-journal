I am on the 4th chapter at CS50P, Exceptions handling.  It's been interesting to see new approaches to write code.
But my main problem is again the imposter syndrome. It kicked in violently, and normally at this point I would talk myself out of pursuing this career,
I would find excuse why I shouldn't invest my time in this whole "coding journey".
This time, I went online to find inspirational stories of people who found their new career after 40.
